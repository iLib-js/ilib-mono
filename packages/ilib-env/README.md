# ilib-env

Detect various things in the runtime environment.

## Usage

This package can be used to detect the following things:

- The current platform
- The current locale
- The current time zone
- The current browser
- The top scope and whether variables are global in the current environment

See the [full API documentation](./docs/ilibEnv.md).

## Installation

```
npm install ilib-env

or

yarn add ilib-env
```

### The Current Platform

Return the name of the platform upon which the code is currently running.

```javascript
ES2015:

var ilibEnv = require("ilib-env");
var platform = ilibEnv.getPlatform();

ES6:

import { getPlatform } from 'ilib-env';
const platform = getPlatform();

or

import ilibEnv from 'ilib-env';
const platform = ilibEnv.getPlatform();
```

This will return a string that names the platform upon which the package is running.
The string will have one of the following values:

- browser: this code is running in a browser. Use getBrowser() to you need to know which one.
- nodejs: this code is running on nodejs
- qt: this code is running under QML inside of QT
- rhino: this code is running inside of Rhino or Nashorn
- trireme: this code is running inside of Trireme
- unknown: the platform is not recognized
- webos-webapp: the code is running in a web application on WebOS
- webos: the code is running in a WebOS app

### The Current Locale

Return the BCP-47 locale specifier for the platform on which this code is running.

```javascript
ES2015:

var ilibEnv = require("ilib-env");
var locale = ilibEnv.getLocale();

ES6:

import { getLocale } from 'ilib-env';
const locale = getLocale();

or

import ilibEnv from 'ilib-env';
const locale = ilibEnv.getLocale();
```

If the platform supports the `Intl` object, this function will use it to determine
the current locale. (This includes most modern browsers and nodejs). If there is no
`Intl` object, or the locale is not specified in the `Intl` object, this function
will check various environment variables to find the locale. If none can be found,
it will return a default of "en-US".

### The Current Time Zone

Return the IANA timezone specifier for the platform on which this code is running.

```javascript
ES2015:

var ilibEnv = require("ilib-env");
var timezone = ilibEnv.getTimeZone();

ES6:

import { getTimeZone } from 'ilib-env';
const timezone = getTimeZone();

or

import ilibEnv from 'ilib-env';
const timezone = ilibEnv.getTimeZone();
```

If the platform supports the `Intl` object, this function will use it to determine
the current timezone. (This includes most modern browsers and nodejs). If there is no
`Intl` object, or the timezone is not specified in the `Intl` object, this function
will check various environment variables to find the timezone. If none can be found,
it will return a default of "local".

### The Current Browser

Return the name of the browser on which this code is running. If the code is not
runningn on a browser (ie. the getPlatform() function does not return "browser")
then the return value of this function is undefined.

```javascript
ES2015:

var ilibEnv = require("ilib-env");
if (ilibEnv.getPlatform() === "browser") {
    browser = ilibEnv.getBrowser();
}

ES6:

import { getPlatform, getBrowser } from 'ilib-env';
if (getPlatform() === "browser") {
    browser = getBrowser();
}

or

import ilibEnv from 'ilib-env';
if (ilibEnv.getPlatform() === "browser") {
    browser = ilibEnv.getBrowser();
}
```

This function returns one of the following values:

- firefox
- opera
- chrome
- ie
- safari
- Edge
- iOS

If the browser name cannot be determined, this function returns undefined

### The Top Scope

You can retrieve the top scope of the platform using the `top()` function
and you can check whether or not a variable is defined in the top scope
using the `isGlobal()` function.

```javascript
ES2015:

var ilibEnv = require("ilib-env");
var top = ilibEnv.top();
if (ilibEnv.isGlobal("variableName")) {
    // safe to reference variableName
}

ES6:

import { top, isGlobal } from 'ilib-env';
const top = top();
if (isGlobal("variableName")) {
    // safe to reference variableName
}

or

import ilibEnv from 'ilib-env';
const top = ilibEnv.top();
if (ilibEnv.isGlobal("variableName")) {
    // safe to reference variableName
}
```

## Release Notes

### v1.4.0
* Update to detect webOS platform with webOSSystem value.

### v1.3.3

* Fixed a problem where platform detection would happen every time it was
  called instead of using the cached value of the platform.
* converted all tests from nodeunit to jest
* updated dependencies
* added the ability to test on headless browsers from the command-line

### v1.3.2

* This module is now a hybrid ESM/CommonJS package that works under node
  or webpack

### v1.3.1

* Removed dependency on polyfills that are not needed, which should make this
  easier to depend upon.

### v1.3.0

* Now ships both the ES6 modules in the src directory and the commonjs code
  (transpiled with babel) in the lib directory. Callers can choose which one
  they would like to use.

### v1.2.1

* Updated to use polyfills with babel for node 10 and for older browsers
* Updated dependencies

### v1.2.0

* Added `setLocale` and `setTimeZone` functions. These override the values
  that are gleaned from the platform. To reset them and get the values from
  the platform again, call the functions again with no arguments before calling
  the getters.

### v1.1.0

* When two different copies of ilib-env are loaded from different node_modules
  directories or an app loads two copies of ilib-env with different version
  numbers, they will be copies of each other with separate variables in
  them. When that happens, setting
  the platform, timezone, or locale for the entire app will not work because
  each copy of ilib-env will have a different idea of what those variables are.
  The solution is to save the settings in the global scope so that they are
  shared between all copies of ilib-env.
* update dependencies

### v1.0.2

* Fixed a bug where locales from the platform returned by getLocale() were not
  recognized properly if any of the following apply:
    * They have underscores in them
    * They have a 3 letter language name ("yue" means "Cantonese" for example)
    * They have a three digit UN.49 region name ("001" is the "The World",
      for example)
    * They have a variant on them ("zh-Hant-TW-u-PostOffice" should return the
      basic locale "zh-Hant-TW" as the platform locale)

### v1.0.1

- fixed some lint problems
- added API documentation
- now can test on web browsers automatically
- Fixed various bugs parsing the platform locales in getLocale()
    * Locales with a script code such as "zh-Hans-CN"
    * The posix "C" default locale
    * Platforms where the region code is not upper-case
    * Platforms that don't use a dash to separate the components
    * Platforms that include a dot and a charset name after the specifier

### v1.0.0

- Initial version
