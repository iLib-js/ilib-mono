# ilib-assemble

Tool to assemble ilib locale data from various ilib packages into single
locale files so that all of the data for a single locale can be loaded
quickly and efficiently. The single files are also useful for webpack, and
replace the functionality previously provided by the old ilib-webpack-loader
and ilib-webpack-plugin extensions to webpack.

## Installation

```
npm install ilib-assemble

or

yarn add ilib-assemble
```

Then, in your package.json, add a script:

```
"scripts": {
    "assemble": "ilib-assemble ./locale"
}
```

Please note: nodejs version 16 or above is required to run this tool, as it
is written with ESM modules.

## Purpose

The purpose of the ilib-assemble tool is to find out which ilib packages
your application uses, and then assemble together the locale data from those
ilib packages for the requested list of locales into single files so
that they can be loaded quickly or so that they can be included into webpack
bundles easily.

The idea is that your build system should run this tool each time you build
your product so that it has the correct locale data each time. This way, if
you start using a new ilib package, it will automatically include the locale
data for that package into your files, and from there in your webpack
bundles. (See ilib-loader and ilib-localedata)

N.B. Currently, this tool only works with the independent ilib-* packages, not
the monolithic "ilib" package itself. To include the locale data for the ilib
package into webpack, you have to use the ilib-webpack-loader and
ilib-webpack-plugin extensions to webpack.

(Update) Since the version v1.3.0, this tool has a ability to assemble the monolithic "ilib" package.
We decided to call it as 'legacy' version ilib. It works to use legacyilib flag. 
Some of additional options are added to support it. Please refer to the option description of usage ("ilibPath", "ilibincPath", "outjsFileName").

## Basic Operation

The basic operation of the tool is this:

1. Scan your app for javascript files, including those within the node_modules.
2. Read each js file it finds in the given directories, and remember all imports and requires
   of packages that start with "ilib-"
3. For each ilib package found in step 2, figure out whether or not that package publishes
   an `assemble.mjs` file. If so, load it, and find the default function it exports. Call
   that function with the list of locales as a parameter, and it should return all of the
   locale data required for the given locales. The data returned should look like this:
    ```json
    {
      "en-US": {
        "package-basename": { American locale data here }
      },
      "ko-KR": {
        "package-basename": { Korean locale data here }
      },
      [etc]
    }
    ```
   The idea is that the `assemble.mjs` module that comes with each ilib-* package contains
   the know-how of assembling the locale data for that package so that the ilib-assemble
   tool doesn't need deep knowledge of each ilib-* package.
4. Merge the data from each call in step 3 together into one big piece of data. This creates
   data like this (with 3 example basenames):
    ```json
    {
      "en-US": {
        "localeinfo": { American locale info },
        "datefmt": { American date formats },
        "numfmt": { American number formats }
      },
      "ko-KR": {
        "localeinfo": { Korean locale info },
        "datefmt": { Korean date formats },
        "numfmt": { Korean number formats }
      }
    }
    ```
5. For each locale from step 4, write out a file with that data either in json form
    or as an ESM or CommonJS module. ie. outputDir/en-US.js, outputDir/ko-KR.js

The data can then be loaded by the ilib-localedata package for use in the various ilib-*
packages.

## Basic Operation for legacy version of ilib
1. Write the `inc` file to specify which files to assemble.
   If not, the default file `./src/ilib-all-inc.js` will be used which assembles all ilib classes and data together.  
   If you only need a subset of ilib, copy this file and delete the parts you do not need.
2. Read the javscript files from the inc file list and extract the list of dependent JS and locale data.
3. After the tool has finished executing, the two types of files (code, data) will be placed the `output-dir`.  
   One is for the result of all JS files merged into a single usable file. If the file name is not specified, the default file name is `ilib-all.js`. and another file is for the locale data per `[locale].js`.  
   The data is written as follows: `ilib.data_[feature]_locale = { [data] }`  
   Here is an example of localeinfo for the ko-KR locale.
   ```js
   ilib.data.localeinfo_ko = { [data] }
   ilib.data.localeinfo_ko_KR = { [data] }
   ilib.data.localeinfo_und_KR = { [data] }
   ```

## Usage

```
ilib-assemble [options] output-dir [input-dir-or-file ...]
```

The ilib-assemble tool takes the following options:

* --compressed or -c. The data should appear in compressed/minified form
* --format or -f. Specify the format of the output files. This can be one of:
    - json: the output files should be written in plain json form
    - js: the output should be written as an ESM module that exports a
      default function which returns the locale data for that locale
    - cjs: the output should be written as a CommonJS module that
      exports function which returns the locale data for that locale
* --locales or -l. A comma separated list of locale specifiers in BCP-47 format
    for the locales that your app supports.
* --localefile or -x. Name a json file that contains an array that lists the
    locales you want your webapp to support. The json should contain a `locales`
    property which is an array of BCP-47 style locale tags. No default.
* --module or -m. Explicitly add the locale data for a module that is not otherwise
    mentioned in the source code. Parameter gives a relative path to the module,
    including the leading './'. Typically, this would be in ./node_modules, but
    it could be anywhere on disk. This option may be specified multiple times,
    once for each module to add. The value is the name of the module to add.
  --quiet or -q. Produce no progress output during the run, except for error messages.
* --resources or -r. Include translated resource files, usually the output from
    in the output files such that they can be loaded with ilib-resbundle. The
    resource files should come from ilib's [loctool](http://github.com/ilib-js/loctool)
    or other such localization tool which produces a set of translated resource
    files. VAL is the path to the root of a resource file tree. You can specify
    this option multiple times, once for each resources directory.
* -legacyilib. The flag to indicate assemble the legacy version of ilib.
* --ilibPath or -i. Specify the location where the legacy version of ilib is installed.
* --ilibincPath or -f. Specify name of javascript file to process. If not given,
    the default (`./src/ilib-all-inc.js`)file will be used.
* --outjsFileName or n. Specify the resulting assembled output file name.
    The default is `ilib-all.js`
* --customLocalePath or p. Specify the path to customized locale data that
    overrides existing open-source locale data.

The output-dir is required and specifies the directory where the output is
written. If it does not exist, it will be created first.

The input directories are optional. If not specified, the ilib-assemble tool will
start in the current directory and recursively search the directory tree from
there. If individual files are specified, only those files are searched.

## Using the ilib-assemble Output With Webpack

If you would like to use the output from ilib-assemble with webpack, you can
do so by first running the tool and putting the output into a subdirectory of your
app. The suggested directory is "locale" but you can name it anything you like.

Then, you will have to modify your webpack configuration to point the
webpack locale data loader within ilib at your directory. You do this by
creating a resolve alias in your `webpack.config.js` file:

```json
    "resolve": {
        "alias": {
            "calling-module": "./locale"
        }
    }
```

The "calling-module" alias should point to the path where the directory full
of locale files are located which were created using ilib-assemble.

Additionally, the ilib-* packages depend on a package called `ilib-loader`
which knows how to load files on various platforms. Under webpack, most of
those loader subclasses are not useful and do not need to be included in
the webpack bundles. In order to exclude them, add the following to your
`webpack.config.js`:

```json
    "externals": {
        "./NodeLoader": "NodeLoader",
        "./QtLoader": "QtLoader",
        "./RhinoLoader": "RhinoLoader",
        "./NashornLoader": "NashornLoader",
        "./RingoLoader": "RingoLoader"
    },
```

See the documentation for [ilib-loader](https://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-loader)
for more details.

## Release Notes

### v1.3.0
- Removed the `mkdirp` package dependency.
- Add the ability to assemble the legacy version of iLib.  
  When the legacyilib flag is set, it assembles files in the legacy style, which refers to the files from iLib. The generated output includes separate files for JS code and locale data: one JS file containing the JS code and iLib's root locale data, and additional JSON files for 
  locale-specific data. Currently, it generates files in the `[language].js` format.   
  The end result is similar to the result of assembling ilib using webpack or rollup, but it is simpler and produces data files as javascript which can be used in other situations without requiring you to use webpack or rollup.  
e.g
```
 ilib-assemble output-dir --legacyilib --ilibPath ~/Source/develop/ --ilibincPath src/ilib-all-inc.js -l "af-ZA,am-ET,ko-KR"
```
- Add the option `customLocalePath` to override the locale data with custom data.  
  The open-source locale data is based only on the CLDR. If your company wants override certain settings, it can create custom JSON locale data in the same format and the same locale hierarchy as the ilib files, and any data in the custom files will override the parallel data from CLDR.


### v1.2.1
- converted all unit tests from nodeunit to jest

### v1.2.0

- added --resources option to include translated resource files into the
  output bundle
- fixed missing dependencies

### v1.1.2

- work with the hybrid commonjs/ESM modules

### v1.1.1

- Updated dependencies to avoid the polyfill bloat

### v1.1.0

- added the ability to add a nodule to the list of modules to include the locale
  data for. This is often used to include the locale data of the current
  package for testing.
- added the ability to get the list of locales to process from a json file
- locale data in js files now get output as a function that returns the data. That
  way you don't need any babel plugins to process exported const values.
  (ie. you don't need babel-plugin-transform-add-module-exports)
- only resolve paths to modules when they are module references. That is, they are
  not relative to the current dir nor are they absolute paths

### v1.0.0

- initial version
- Code to replace the ilib-webpack-loader and ilib-webpack-plugin by
  performing the same task, but outside of webpack.
