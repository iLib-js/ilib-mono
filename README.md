# ilib-lint-react

An ilib-lint plugin that provides the ability to parse React files and
provides rules to check resources that come from code written in React.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev ilib-lint-react

or

yarn add --dev ilib-lint-react
```

Then, in your `ilib-lib-config.json`, add some configuration:

```
    "plugins": [
        "react"
    ],
    "filetypes": {
        "jsx": {
            "parser": "jsx",
            "ruleset": [ "react" ]
        },
        "js": {
            "parser": "js",
            "ruleset": [ "javscript" ]
        }
    },
    "paths": {
        "src/**/*.jsx": "jsx",
        "src/**/*.js": "js"
    }
```

Please note: nodejs version 14 or above is required to run ilib-lint, as it
is written with ESM modules.

## Parsers

This plugin provides multiple parsers:

- FlowParser - parser for Javascript using flow type definitions, and for
JSX files that use flow type definitions
- JSParser - parser for plain Javascript files
- JSXParser - parser for Javscript React JSX files
- TSXParser - parser for Typescript files that may use React JSX
- PropertiesParser - parser for properties files as used for translated
  strings in the react-intl library

Some projects use the file extension "js" instead of "jsx" for their JSX
files. If you are not sure what is in your files that have a "js" extension,
then use the JSXParser to be safe. Both parsers produce the same form of
intermediate representation that the rules can parse, and the JSX parser
has the ability to parse regular javascript as well as JSX syntax. You
should use the JSParser only if you want strict Javascript syntax which
throws exceptions if the file attempts to use JSX syntax.

## Rules

The following rules apply to any resources from any file type, but are
designed to check resources that come from react code:

- [ban-formattedcompmessage](./docs/ban-formattedcompmessage.md) - The component
  FormattedCompMessage in the box-ui-elements is deprecated and should not be used
- [no-hard-coded-strings](./docs/no-hard-coded-strings.md) - Check for hard-coded
  strings in your jsx code
- [no-nested-messages](./docs/no-nested-messages.md) - Check whether the
  component FormattedMessage from react-intl is used in the children of another
  FormattedMessage
- source-formatjs-plurals - check that any React-intl style plurals have
  correct syntax (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

## RuleSets

This plugin defines one ruleset `react` that will turn on all the rules
that this plugin supports. Users may rely on this ruleset when defining their
file types.

## Release Notes

### v2.0.1

- Fixed a bug where the exports were not properly set up in the package.json

### v2.0.0

- Updated dependency from i18nlint-common to ilib-lint-common
    - IntermediateRepresentation now takes a SourceFile as an
      parameter to the constructor instead of a file path
    - Parser constructor no longer takes a file path. Instead,
      the Parser.parse method takes a SourceFile parameter
    - can now be loaded by ilib-lint >= v2

### v1.4.2

- fixed a bug where HTML attribute values that are localizable but which
  are empty were marked as hard-coded strings. Now it no longer complains
  about those attribute values unless there is at least one non-whitespace
  character in the string.

### v1.4.1

- fixed a bug where the different parsers did not have unique names
- clarified the documentation about the various parser names and what the
  parsers are used for
- minor documentation updates

### v1.4.0

- added rule to check for usages of FormattedMessage or calls to intl.formatMessage()
  within the children of another FormattedMessage component. That indicates broken
  and unlocalizable strings.

### v1.3.0
- added Typescript and TSX parser
- changed existing JavaScript, JSX, Flow, FlowJSX parsers to all produce Babel-style AST
- added rule to ban usage of FormattedCompMessage
- added rule to check for hard-coded strings and attributes in React code

### v1.2.0

- add a parser for JS or JSX code that uses flow types (FlowParser).
  This parser produces the same ESTree style of AST as the JS and
  JSX parsers.
- update dependencies
- convert unit tests from nodeunit to jest

### v1.1.1

- forgot to expose the properties parser to the consumers of this lib

### v1.1.0

- added a parser for properties files
    - produces an array of Resource instances

### v1.0.0

- initial version
- Parser for jsx and js files
- Rules for react resources
