A parser and generator for GNU po format files

## API Documentation

Full API documentation can be found [here](./docs/index.md).
HTML version can be found [here](./docs/index.html).

## Quick Start

Parsing a file in PO format:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { POFile } from 'ilib-po';

let po = new POFile();
const data: string = fs.readFileSync('path/to/po/file.po', 'utf-8');
const translationSet = po.parse(data);

// resources is now an array of all the resources in the PO file
const resources: Resource[] = translationSet.getAll();
```

Generating a file in PO format:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { TranslationSet, ResourceString } from 'ilib-tools-common';
import { POFile } from 'ilib-po';

const po = new POFile();
const translationSet = new TranslationSet();
const res = new ResourceString({
    sourceLocale: 'en-US',
    targetLocale: 'fr-FR',
    datatype: 'x-json',
    key: 'hello',
    source: 'Hello, world!',
    target: 'Bonjour, le monde!'
});
translationSet.add(res);
const data: string = po.generate(translationSet);
// data now contains the contents of the PO file

fs.writeFileSync('path/to/output/file.po', data, 'utf-8');
```

Make sure to use UTF-8 encoding when reading and writing PO files as they can contain Unicode characters
in the translated files.

## Release Notes

### v1.1.0

- Added the ability to encode ResourceArray resources. The array elements
  are encoded as separate resources with the key of the array resource
  and the index of the array element both encoded in new types of comments
  in the po file. These are po file format extensions which are mostly
  ignored by other po file tools, but are used by the ilib-po parser and
  generator to encode the array elements in a reversible way.
- The above work with ResourceArray resources now also allow you to add
  a key to each resource that is different than source string. This goes
  for all resource types, not just arrays.
- Fixed a bug where resources that have comments in them which are not
  in json format were parsed as if they were json. Now the parser will
  only treat comments as json if they start with a '{' character.
