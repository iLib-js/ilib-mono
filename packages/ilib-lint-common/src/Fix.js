class Fix {
    /**
     * A subclass of Fix can contain any properties - it is up to
     * the corresponding Fixer (i.e. with a matching {@link Fix.type})
     * to interpret them appropriately and apply them
     * to the IntermediateRepresentation.
     *
     * Due to that, a recommended approach is that the Fixer
     * should also be a Fix factory, so that the Rule
     * could only express the Fix instructions with
     * capabilities that the Fixer provides.
     *
     * Example scenario:
     *
     * Take an IntermediateRepresentation with type `string`
     * which stores content of a file verbatim:
     *
     * ```text
     * birds are not real birds are not real birds are not real
     * ```
     *
     * and a Rule (type `string`) which ensures that the word `birds`
     * should always be surrounded by quotes.
     *
     * Rule would produce the following results:
     * 1. birds are not quoted (span 0 - 5)
     * 2. birds are not quoted (span 19 - 24)
     * 3. birds are not quoted (span 38 - 43)
     *
     * To fix each of them, quotes need to be inserted:
     * 1. fix: insert quote at 0 and 5
     * 2. fix: insert quote at 19 and 24
     * 3. fix: insert quote at 38 and 43
     *
     * If there are no Fix and Fixer with type `string`,
     * they could be implemented like in the following example:
     *
     * ```js
     * class StringFixCommand {
     *     commandId;
     *     position;
     * }
     * 
     * class InsertCommand extends StringFixCommand {
     *     commandId = "INSERT";
     *     content;
     * }
     * 
     * class RemoveCommand extends StringFixCommand {
     *     commandId = "REMOVE";
     *     length;
     * }
     * 
     * class StringFix extends Fix {
     *     commands; // StringFixCommand[]
     * }
     * 
     * class StringFixer {
     *     applyFixes(representation, fixes) {} // applyFixes(representation: IntermediateRepresentation, fixes: StringFix[]): void
     *     createFix(commands) {}               // createFix(commands: StringFixCommand[]): StringFix
     *     insertStringAt(position, content) {} // insertStringAt(position: number, content: string): InsertCommand
     *     removeStringAt(position, length) {}  // removeStringAt(position: number, length: number): RemoveCommand
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Rule should then accept an instance of a StringFixer,
     * and for each produced result provide a fix:
     *
     * ```
     * new Result({
     *     // ...
     *     fix: fixer.createFix([fixer.insertStringAt(0, "\""), fixer.insertStringAt(5, "\"")])
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * So that the linter could call
     * ```
     * fixer.applyFixes(ir, results.map(r => r.fix))
     * ```
     * @abstract
     * @constructor
     */
