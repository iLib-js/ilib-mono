# ilib-localedata

A class that knows how to load and cache ilib locale data.

The LocaleData class relies on ilib-loader to be able to
load files from where-ever they are stored. This may take the
form of actual files in json form, or other methods, such as
webpacked lazy-load modules. The locale data class does not
need to know the details!

The LocaleData class converts a package name, a locale, and
a basename into the appropriate set of files name to attempt
to load the requested data.
