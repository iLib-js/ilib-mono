/**
 * @class Superclass of the loader classes that contains shared functionality.
 *
 * Loaders are the layer of code that knows how to load files from where-ever
 * they are stored based on the platform and environment. They do not know
 * anything about the file contents other than that they are in plain text
 * and they are encoded in UTF-8.<p>
 *
 * All loaders must support asynchronous operation. That is, they take
 * a file name or a list of file names and return a promise to load
 * them. Some loader may optionally also support synchronous operation
 * as well if the locale files are located locally and the platform supports
 * it.<p>
