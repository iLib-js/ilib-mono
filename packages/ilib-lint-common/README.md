Common ilib-lint routines and classes/interfaces that the ilib-lint plugins
will need to implement the plugin functionality.


## Installation

```

## Release Notes

### v3.1.0
- added formatOutput() method to the Formatter class

### v3.0.0

- Update major version because of these breaking changes which need to be
  updated in the plugins:
    - Added a SourceFile class to represent the original source file
      that is being parsed. This gives access to the raw bytes of the file,
      the file represented as a single string in Unicode, or to the file
      as an array of lines in Unicode.
    - Parser constructor no longer takes a filePath argument in the
      options object. Instead, the parse() method now takes a SourceFile
      argument. This means that ilib-lint will only create 1 instance of
      the parser instead of one per source file as it did before. It will
      then call the parse method multiple times with different source
      files to produce the intermediate representations of that file
    - The IntermediateRepresentation constructor no longer takes a filePath
      argument in the options object as well. Instead, it takes a SourceFile
      instance, giving the IntermediateRepresentation and any class that
      uses it access to the original raw content of the file or the
      representation of the file as a string or an array of lines. This will
      make it easier for Fixer and Fix instances to operate on the original
      file and for the Rules to generate the correct snippets of the original
      file to show where the issue occurred.
- renamed from i18nlint-common to ilib-lint-common to go along with the name of
  the tool

### v2.2.1

- changed the documentation for the return value of getRules and getFormatters
  so that it can be an array of classes or objects that definition declarative
  rules or formatters. This was already the case, but not documented properly.
- updated dependencies
- converted all unit tests from nodeunit to jest

### v2.2.0

- added Fix and Fixer to allow implementing auto-fixing of Results

### v2.1.0

- added the FileStats class
- added fields to the Result object for the location of the issue

### v2.0.1

- fix a problem where you could not create a Result instance with a
  lineNumber equal to 0.

### v2.0.0

- added Parser.getType() method
- clarified some jsdocs
    - Rule.match() should return a Result instance, an array of
      Result instances, or undefined if no match
- added IntermediateRepresentation class to represent the results of
  parsing a file
- Parser.parse() should now return the intermediate representation
    - this requires the plugins to change, so the major version is bumped
- Added support for logging provided by the lint tool so that plugins
  can use the linter's logging
    - getLogger() function passed to the constructors

### v1.4.0

- added utility function withVisibleWhitespace() to visually represent whitespace characters
- added isKebabCase(), isSnakeCase(), and isCamelCase() utility functions

### v1.3.0

- added getLink() method to the Rule class

### v1.2.0

- update the plugin to return only classes, as the linter may need to instantiate
  the classes multiple times
- add the getRuleSets() method to the plugin to allow the plugins to define
  standard rule sets

### v1.1.0

- added methods to abstract classes needed for loading and testing the plugins

### v1.0.0

- initial version
- define initial code and default built-in rules
