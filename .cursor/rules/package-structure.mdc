# Package Structure Standards

## Package Organization
Each package in the `packages/` directory should follow this structure:
- `package.json` - Package configuration and dependencies
- `src/` - Source code files
- `lib/` - Compiled/built files (generated)
- `locale/` - Locale data
- `test/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- `README.md` - Package-specific documentation

## Package.json Requirements
- Include standard required scripts: `build`, `clean`, `coverage`, `debug`, `test`
  The standard scripts need to be there in every packages even if they are empty for that package.
- Include optional standard scripts if necessary: `doc`, `build:assemble`, `build:pkg`, `test:cli`, `test:web`
- Use the 'workspace:' protocol for internal dependencies: `"ilib-common": "workspace:^"`
- Include proper `main`, `module`, and `types` fields for different module systems
- Specify Node.js version compatibility (>=12.0.0)
- Include appropriate keywords for npm discovery

## Source Code Organization
- Place main entry points in `src/index.js`
- Organize code by functionality in subdirectories
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Include a `src/index.js` file that exports the public API

## Testing Structure
- Mirror the source directory structure in `test/`
- Include unit tests for all public APIs
- Use descriptive test file names that match the source files
- Include integration tests for complex workflows
- Maintain good test coverage (aim for >80%)

## Documentation
- Include descriptive JSDoc or TSDoc comments for all public APIs.
    - These should be useful enough that anyone who does not know the package already will understand what each class and method does.
- Provide usage examples in README.md
- Document configuration options and environment variables
- Include migration guides for breaking changes

## Build Configuration
- Use Babel for transpilation when needed
- Configure build tools to target Node.js >=12.0.0
- Generate source maps for debugging
- Optimize bundle size for browser usage when applicable
