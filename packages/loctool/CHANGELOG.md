# loctool

## 2.31.3

### Patch Changes

- 7af420b: Clean up the xliff files for the loctool test by separating the test files for the XLIFF 2.0 format and the webOS XLIFF format, and deleting unnecessary files.
- 6978961: Normalize and deduplicate translationsDir paths

## 2.31.2

### Patch Changes

- d3865cf: Assign structured unit IDs with group index during xliff serialization for webOS

## 2.31.1

### Patch Changes

- edc242f: Fixed a case where XliffFactory was not being used.
- Updated dependencies [32130cf]
  - ilib-tools-common@1.19.0

## 2.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 90814bf: - Add a `metadata` property to the `Resource` class to store any metadata that may exist on a per-Resource basis. It is up to parsers to recognize and parse the metadata appropriately and up to the serializers to serialize it properly again.
  - Update to pass `style` property in `GenerateMode` to work with correct XliffFile class.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [2f63633]
  - ilib-tools-common@1.18.0

## 2.30.0

### Minor Changes

- da9e913: \* Add the `XliffFactory` to support various XLIFF formats.
  It creates an instance of either the `Xliff` class or the new `webOSXliff` class, depending on whether itâ€™s targeting the webOS platform or another use case. Additional format support can be added in the same way if required.
  - Update loctool options:
    - Add the new `--metadata` option.
      It accepts key-value pairs in the form `aaa=bbb` (e.g. --metadata device=Monitor), and is currently used by webOSXliff.
    - Remove the `custom` option from `--xliffStyle`. Instead, the option `webOS` will be used.
      Previously, the content of the `custom` option was already parsed as xliff for webOS.

## 2.29.3

### Patch Changes

- b4ee2a5: - Fix incorrect handling of the deprecated xliffsDir
  setting in a project.json file

## 2.29.2

### Patch Changes

- 990af01: - Deprecate the xliffsDir setting to be replaced by the
  translationsDir setting instead. The reason is that
  this directory may now contain translations that are
  not encoded as xliff files but in some other resource
  file format instead! - all users should transition to using the
  --translationsDir command-line option and the
  "translationsDir" property in the settings in
  their ilib-lint-config.json file. - xliffDir will be removed in the next major
  update to loctool

## 2.29.1

### Patch Changes

- 575c69b: Change the duplicate option name.

## 2.29.0

### Minor Changes

- a3296df: - added the ability to add extended attributes
  to translation units
  - added the ability to specify the project name
    and extended attributes for the select command
    on the command-line
  - the select command automatically adds an extended
    attribute containing the name of the original
    file where the selected translation unit comes
    from

## 2.28.2

### Patch Changes

- 5e58323: - Fixed a problem where the project that convert needs to
  instantiate in order to run tried to find and load every
  single xliff file in the current directory recursively as
  translations file in the xliffDir. The problem comes in
  if there are many xliff files in the current directory
  or there are many directories underneath the current
  working directory. That caused start-up to take a really
  long time.
  - The fix is to for the convert action to turn off
    loading translation files when instantiating a project.
    They are not needed anyways.
- Updated dependencies [9cadb43]
- Updated dependencies [c5ee237]
  - ilib-po@1.1.1
  - ilib-tools-common@1.14.0

## 2.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 9818185: Fix a bug reading multi-level xliff dirs

  - if the xliff dir named in the config or the command
    line contained multiple directory levels (as opposed to
    everything being in the root of that xliff dir), the code
    miscalculated the relative path those those resource
    files and therefore could not load them. This is now
    fixed.

## 2.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 32ac524: Modified the way loctool reads translated resource files

  - The way loctool reads resource files from the xliffsDir directories
    has changed.
    - Previously, it would read `[dir]/*.xliff` and now it reads `[dir]/**/*.xliff`
      or `[dir]/**/*.po`. That is, it reads each directory recursively.
  - renamed -x and --xliffsDir to -t and --translations but the old
    command-line arguments are still accepted
  - does not read only resource files that have a locale in their
    file name. It reads all files in the xliffDir.

- 90c28fa: - added the ability to read and write .pot files as
  intermediate file format and as translation file
  format.
  - Also, .po file can still be read and written if necessary
    as the format for po and pot files are the same.

### Patch Changes

- 4965315: Now uses ICU<->Plural conversion code from the ilib-tools-common library instead of its
  own implementation. This way, the code can be shared between tools.
- Updated dependencies [4965315]
- Updated dependencies [32ac524]
  - ilib-tools-common@1.13.0

## 2.27.0

### Minor Changes

- fb8b2eb: Updated the plural categories that loctool uses to those defined in CLDR 46.1

## 2.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 0672f4c: - Added the ability to read and write intermediate files in po format - Added a new command-line parameter "--intermediateFormat" to choose
  between xliff (default) and po - The output intermediate files are the `<project>-extracted.<ext>` and
  `<project>-new-<locale>.<ext>` files. - Can represent all of string, plural, or array resources - Can also read po or xliff files as the source of translations
  in the xliffs dir. (Unfortunately, the parameter is still called
  xliffsDir even though it may now contain po files with translations.)

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f9f1095]
- Updated dependencies [0672f4c]
- Updated dependencies [ae2549a]
  - ilib-tools-common@1.12.2
  - ilib-po@1.1.0
  - message-accumulator@3.0.2
  - ilib-tree-node@2.0.1

## 2.25.3

### Patch Changes

- ff316a5: Updated message-accumulator and ilib-tree-node to the latest major version.
- ff316a5: Linked dependencies within the monorepo.
- Updated dependencies [ff316a5]
  - message-accumulator@3.0.1

## 2.25.2

New Features:

Bug fixes:

- fixed a bug in Utils.formatPath where it did not format the correct
  basename of a file if the file name did not have an extension on it

## 2.25.1

New Features:

Bug fixes:

- fixed a bug in loctool select where it was possible to select the same
  trans units twice by specifying the input files twice or by having the
  same trans units located in different input files. Now the files and
  trans units are filtered for uniqueness before the selection criteria
  are applied to them.

## 2.25.0

New Features:

- Added the --convertPlurals command line flag for the localize
  action. This converts plural resources extracted from the plugins into
  plural strings that use the ICU-style plural syntax. The reason
  for this is to support translation management servers that cannot
  read plurals from xliff files. Instead, we "shoehorn" the plurals
  into the server using single plural strings. During source string
  extraction, the plurals are converted to strings. During localization,
  the strings are converted back into plurals again before they are
  sent to the plugins to write them out again in the resource file format.

## 2.24.1

New Features:

Bug fixes:

- Removed unused mysql dependencies to avoid mysql2 security
  vulnerabilities
- Fixed a bug where xliff files in the xliffs dir which had a locale
  that used numeric region codes were not being recognized and
  therefore never read. This meant that no localization could happen
  to locales with numeric region codes. (example locale spec: "es-419")

## 2.24.0

New Features:

- Added a new `getProjectType()` method on the Project class.
- Add a new "select" command to select translation units from some xliff
  files and write them out to a new xliff file
  - allows for the selection based on regular expressions that
    match in certain field values
    - can search for regular expressions in plural category values
      or array values
  - allows limitations like maximum unit count or maximum word
    count in the source or target strings
  - allows for random selection to create samples of the input files

Bug fixes:

- Removed unused dependencies.
- Updated remaining dependencies.
- Converted all unit tests from nodeunit to jest.
- Removed the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` in repository.

## 2.23.1

Bug fixes:

- forgot to include the npm-shrinkwrap.json in the published files
  list with the last release. Now it is there.

## 2.23.0

New Features:

- changed the `zxx-Hans-XX` pseudo style name to `debug-han-simplified`.

## 2.22.0

New Features:

- added new `debug-font` pseudoLocale style. It transform the source strings into strings of characters
  that require a different font. This allows you to test out whether or not the font works in your UI
  without having a real translation.
  e.g.
  ```
  "pseudoLocale": {
    "am-XX": "debug-font",
  },
  ```

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed bug where resources with no source would sometimes appear in the
  extracted and new xliff files.
  - in the ResourceArray constructor: an undefined element
    in the array would get stored as the string "undefined" in the resource array
    instead of the actual value undefined. This messed a lot of things up
  - in projects, filter out any resources, from any plugin, where the
    source is not defined. This goes for strings, arrays, or plurals.

## 2.21.0

New Features:

- added new `resourceDir` parameter support to util's `formatPath()` which is for modifying the resource root path.

Bug Fixes:

## 2.20.3

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- added more explicit logging output in order to be able to debug problems
- fixed a problem where tmx file output was not adding the srclang attribute
  to the header of the tmx file

## 2.20.2

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- convert would not read the local ./project.json which contains settings that could not
  be specified on the command-line. Now, it does!

## 2.20.1

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- Updated to remove duplicate plugins from the list which can reduce duplication of work.
- Fixed ternary operator bug in `getTranslations()` method on the Project class.
- Fixed a bug where attempting to glean the locale from a path using an undefined template
  would cause an error. Instead, it should just return the empty string to indicate that
  no locale was found.

## 2.20.0

New Features:

- Added a new `getRepository()` method on the Project class to get the local repository.
- Added a new `getTranslationSet()` method on the LocalRepository class to get all of the translations.

## 2.19.0

New Features:

- Added the --localeInherit flag which could define custom locale inheritance.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where not correctly filtering pseudo locale.

## 2.18.0

New Features:

- Added the utility function to override language default locale.
- Added new `getTranslations()` method on the Project calss to get all of the translations.

Bug Fixes:

## 2.17.0

New Features:

- Added xliff comments on translation units for [mojito](https://mojito.global) to
  read so that it can recognize plural resources
- Added the ability to specify multiple xliff directories containing translations
  to use. Translation units in the later xliff directories override those found in
  the earlier ones. Xliff dirs found on the command-line override ones found in
  the project.json file.
- Added the utility function to check whether the current locale matches the language default locale.

Bug Fixes:

## 2.16.3

New Features:

- Minimum node version is now v10.0.0+. Older versions of node cannot support
  the packages that loctool depends on.

Bug Fixes:

- upgraded more dependencies
- added more things to the default exclude list that do not include localizable
  strings such as the project.json or package.json files

## 2.16.2

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- upgraded dependencies
  - plural categories are now based on CLDR 40
- fixed a bug where a resource with an zero-length source string caused the
  xliff writer to throw exceptions

## 2.16.1

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug in the utility functions for detecting locales in file names.
  If you had a mapping with a template of "[dir]/[basename]\_[locale].[extension]",
  then the locale was not detected properly.

## 2.16.0

New Features:

- added the ability for the plugins to get their own logger instance from
  the loctool so that the plugin output comes with the regular output
  from the loctool itself. This way, plugins do not need a separate
  logging system of their own.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug in the utility functions for cleaning strings where a bad
  input would cause an exception. Now it checks for bad input and returns
  undefined.

## 2.15.1

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- fixed an exception in utils.formatPath. When a locale does not contain
  a component, and the path template calls for that particular component,
  (for example, "de" has no region, and this template asks for a region:
  "dir/[region]/[filename]"), it should act as if that component is not
  there.
- Updated package dependencies

## 2.15.0

New Features:

- Added the --onlyTranslated flag which causes the convert action
  to only convert translated resources into the target file.
  Source-only resources will be skipped. By default, all resources
  are converted.
- Added [localeLower] as a new template variable that uses lowercased
  BCP-47 locale, e.g. `zh-Hans-CN` => `zh-hans-cn`.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where xliff files were not being read in properly when
  the resource name attribute of translation units contained a
  "slash n" sequence. Previously, it would convert "slash n"
  into a newline. Now, it converts it into a "slash" character
  followed by an "n" character.

## 2.14.2

New Features:

- Added the --noxliffDups flag which does not allow duplicated strings in extracted xliff file

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where the default excluded directory is not exclude

## 2.14.1

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where it was not loading plugins correctly on Windows.
  Switched from using process.env.PWD which does not work on Windows to
  process.cwd() which should work everywhere.
- Fixed exception when you put an unknown substitution parameter into
  an output path template. Now gives a warning instead.
- Fixed a bug where the [basename] in a output file name template was
  not calculated properly if the extension was not ".json". Now you can
  use any extension.

## 2.14.0

New Features:

- Changed the new strings xliff files to contain the correct plural categories
  for the target language. If the target locale has more or less strings than
  the source locale, that will come out in that xliff file.
  - This way, translators just need to translate each string and
    not worry about adding/subtracting categories for the language
- Add the ability to redefine which style of pseudolocalization that each locale uses
  by specifying an object in the pseudolocale setting in project.json.
  - Defined a number of pseudo translation styles such as
    "english-british" or "chinese-traditional-tw"
  - When pseudolocale is an object, it maps a locale to a pseudo style
  - When pseudolocale is set to a string or array, it works as before to
    define which locales are pseudo locales, but locales not explicitly
    listed are no longer considered pseudolocales
  - When pseudolocale is set to an empty string, array, or object, all
    pseudolocalization is turned off, similar to specifying the "nopseudo"
    flag on the command-line

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed some bugs in pseudo locale translation when called from a plugin
- Fixed a bug where Hans pseudo translation crashed when called from a
  plugin because the conversion data had not been loaded yet
  - Upgraded to opencc-js 1.0.3 to get the latest mappings and so that
    the data can be loaded synchronously

## 2.13.1

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the part where the argument number was increased incorrectly
- Make sure the xliffsOut dir exists before attempting to write files there
- Make sure to pass in the target locale as specified on the command line when converting files
- Corrected misspelled function name in ResourcePlural
- Loctool crashed if some plugins don't implement the generatePseudo method
  in the FileType class. Now it tests for the existence of the method before
  attempting to call it.

## 2.13.0

New Features:

- Added the ability for the plugins to see the output locale map so that they can fix the
  locales used to make the output files names.

Bug Fixes:

- Added guard code not to work if the object is empty when setting target locale for conversions

## 2.12.0

New Features:

- Added the --xliffStyle flag which specifies customized xliff format
- Added support for writing TMX files
  - The TMX files are segmented by paragraph (whole strings) or sentence.
- Added a "convert" action to the command-line. This converts files from one format to another:
  - `loctool convert output.tmx input1.xliff input2.xliff ...`
  - files types are recognized by extension
  - you may need plugins to read/write some file types

Bug Fixes:

- the locales to localize to were not set correctly if there are no translation files already.
  This made it harder to start new projects.
- Xliff output didn't work if the source locale was something other than "en-US"

## 2.11.0

New Features:

- Added the --exclude flag which excludes a comma-separated list of directories while searching for project.json config files
- Added support for file path template formatting which plugins can use to generate
  output file paths for localized files

Bug Fixes:

- Updated the code that the key value would be written in xliff only if it's different from the source
- Fixed a bug where plural resources for a locale that has a different number of plural categories than
  the source language would never show those plurals in the xliff output. Now the plurals output of
  xliff files follows the plural categories available in the target language instead of the source language.

## 2.10.3

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- Added guard code to check if a file really exists in the given path before reading

## 2.10.2

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- Added guard code to prevent an error when read directory list returns empty

## 2.10.1

New Features:

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a problem to split xliff 2.0 files
- Updated the documentation to be more clear and to add a description of the xliffsDir setting
- Added guard code not to stop the process even though an xliff path is not valid.

## 2.10.0

New Features:

- Added `group` element under the file element in Xliff format version 2. Each group contains one datatype.
- Added a generate mode for generating resource without scanning source files.
- If the "fullyTranslated" flag is turned on for markdown files, and the
  file is fully translated, then the "fullyTranslated" setting will be
  added to the front matter. If there is no front matter, it will create
  one.

Bug Fixes:

- Updated to remove duplicate locales in a list
- Fixed a problem to parse xliff 2.0 files
- Fixed a problem to merge xliff 2.0 files

## 2.9.0

New Features:

- Add "loctool init" command to generate an initial project.json file that the user can
  use as a starting framework.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a problem where the xliff path is incorrectly converted when the path is absolute.
- Added a condition not to see a warning message when xliff file is loading.
- Loctool could not install or run on certain platforms with certain versions of C++
  compilers installed because the node-gyp compiler did not work right
  - moved from `opencc` to `opencc-js` which is pure JS code, but a little
    bit slower
  - moved from `xml2json` to `xml-js` which is also pure JS code, and also
    a little slower
  - no longer depends on the `PrettyData` module

## 2.8.1

Bug Fixes:

- Fix a problem where the MarkdownFileType was producing the translation-status.json file
  even when the fullyTranslated option is not turned on. If it is not turned on, it is not
  useful anyways so don't produce it.

## 2.8.0

New Features:

- added a "fullyTranslated" setting for the markdown code. This makes sure that if a
  file does not have all of its translations, then that file is produced in the source
  language.
  - Also produces a file in the project root called `translation-status.json`
    that details which files were fully translated and which were not

Bug Fixes:

- Fix a problem with custom projects not loading Android flavors properly
- Loctool was not properly processing subprojects found while walking the tree.
  - didn't put all the output to target dir, which meant it didn't go
    into the subproject's directories, but into dirs that were relative
    to the root project instead

## 2.7.2

Bug Fixes:

- Backtracked to opencc 1.0.6 because the current version (1.1.1) does
  not compile properly on ubuntu with node 12+
- Fixed the parsing and localization of text in table cells
- Fixed the parsing and localization of inline code that is the only part of a localizable
  segment. Inline code is only translatable when it is part of a larger localizable piece of
  text, not when it is by itself.

## 2.7.1

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where xliff files are trying to be created when there was no extracted string.
- Fixed a bug where the xliff files (extracted + new files) were never generated, even when
  localizeOnly is turned off
- Fixed a bug where self-closed tags like <br/> in markdown files were not handled properly,
  causing exceptions that complained about syntax errors

## 2.7.0

New Features:

- Added the -q or --quiet flag which only prints out banners, errors, and warnings
- Added the -s or --silent flag which never prints anything. Instead, it only sets the exit code.
  This is intended to be used in scripts where all the verbose output is not needed.
- Added the --localizeOnly flag which Generate a localization resource only. Do not create any other files at all after running loctool.
- Added support to handle multiple pseudo locales. If you want to use more than one pseudo locale, you have to put the locales in an array. Example:
  ```
  pseudoLocale: ["zxx-XX", "zxx-Hans-XX", "zxx-Hebr-XX"]
  ```
- Added `SourceContextResourceString` that is for strings in qml files. The hash key made with this, that it includes additionally the hash value of the source. That is a difference from ContextResourceString.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed to include locale when creating cleanHashKey in ContextResourceString
- Updated dependencies to the latest packages and fixed the resulting unit test failures due to the opencc update

## 2.6.0

New Features:

- Added support for localizing links and link references in github-flavored markdown files

By default, URLs are not localizable, as the majority are the same
in all languages. Sometimes, however you want to be able to give a
different URL for each locale. With this new features, you can turn
on link localization.

To localize a link in the text, put a localize-links directive around
it, which is an lint-style HTML comment. Example:

```markdown
There are

<!-- i18n-enable localize-links -->

[fifty](http://www.example.com/)

<!-- i18n-disable localize-links -->

of them for sale.
```

The text "fifty" is localized along with the rest of the sentence in the
string:

```
There are <c0>fifty</c0> of them for sale.
```

Note the c0 tags denote where the link goes. The directives, being HTML
comments, are not included in the string to translate.

The URL itself appears as a separate string to translate.

Localizing a link reference is very similar. Surround the reference
definition with a localize-links directive:

```markdown
There are [fifty][url] of them for sale.

<!-- i18n-enable localize-links -->

[url]: http://www.example.com/ "link title"

<!-- i18n-disable localize-links -->
```

The link title for link reference definitions is included as a separate string
to translate.

## 2.5.0

New Features:

- Added support to handle multiple group tags in an xliff file
  - loctool considersed only one group tag in an xliff file. but now we can support a case to have multiple groups in a xliff file

## 2.4.0

New Features:

- Added -v (--version) command-line parameter. Prints out the version from the package.json
  and then exits.
  - Updated the usage to print that as well
- The markdown code now adds a translator comment/note for inline code segments so that the
  translator can know what the text of the self-closing components are.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the link reference support in markdown to support both full and shortcut references
  - Shortcut references are converted to full so that the title can be translated without
    changing the label.
- Now when an exception happens, the loctool process will exit with an error code
  so that scripts that call the loctool can fail appropriately instead of just
  quietly and obliviously carrying on.

Bug Fixes:

- Now when an exception happens, the loctool process will exit with an error code
  so that scripts that call the loctool can fail appropriately instead of just
  quietly and obliviously carrying on.

## 2.3.2

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a problem parsing/localizing valueless HTML attributes in markdown files
- now ignores whitespace before html comments
- now uses remark-frontmatter to parse the headers
- now parses linkreferences properly when the text is not the default

## 2.3.1

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed incorrect npm packaging in v2.3.0. Testing packages were included in
  the dependencies instead of the dev dependencies.

## 2.3.0

New Features:

- Added support for XLIFF 2.0 files
  - Previously, loctool only supported XLIFF 1.2 format files
  - Optionally used for xliff output as well
  - Use the new `-2` option to specify xliff 2.0
  - When xliff 2.0 files are in use, "loctool split" can only split
    xliff files by language because xliff 2.0 does not support translation
    units with differing target locales.
  - Both xliff 1.2 and 2.0 files can be read in regardless of the
    version of the output file. The parser reads the version number from
    the "xliff" tag and parses its contents appropriately.
- Loctool will now read in all xliff files it finds in xliffsDir
  - With xliff 2.0, the loctool cannot load in only one project.xliff
    file because multiple target locales are not allowed to be in the
    same file.
  - As many files are you like may appear in the xliffsDir directory
    and they will be read in to memory as long as the file names end
    with a BCP-47 locale specifier and a ".xliff" extension.
    eg. (project1-de-DE.xliff, project2-de-DE.xliff, ko-KR.xliff, etc.)
- Added support for a new method projectClose() to the FileType plugins SPI
  - Called right before each project is closed
  - Allows the file type class to do any last-minute clean-up or
    generate any final files

Bug Fixes:

- Fix a few bugs related to figuring out which file types are resource file types in custom projects
- Many file types were not producing any translated output for the generated pseudo locales.
  Now they do!
- If you had loctool install in the global node modules, and your loctool plugin installed in your
  project's node modules, it was not finding and loading that plugin. Now loctool will check the
  loctool directory, the current project, and the ../plugins directory for plugins.

## 2.2.0

New Features:

- Added support for link references in markdown
  - link references do not create a break in the translatable
    string any more, and are hidden from the translators using
    xml-like tags

Bug Fixes:

- Markdown fixes
  - filter out strings that only contain URLs
  - filter out strings that do not contain localizable text (only whitespace and/or punctuation)
  - make sure that the text on the lines after the last bullet in a list does not get added to that last list item
  - Fixed a crash that happens when there are more components in the translation than the source string. Now it
    just gives a warning and proceeds as if that extra component were not there.
- Fix dependency on ilib-tree-node
- Added test/testResourceFactory.js to verify the ResourceFactory code
- Added the ability to keep reference links and inline code snippets with the string, even when
  they are at the beginning or end of the string. They are not optimized out. Other components that
  appear at the beginning or end of the string are still optimized out as normal.

## 2.1.0

New Features:

- Added support for plugins
  - Allows loctool to load arbitary npm modules as plugins which handle
    particular types of files
  - Plugins are loaded though the "CustomProject" class which is specified
    in the project.json file with the type "custom"
  - Loctool does not need changes to handle new file types
  - Anyone can now write a plugin for their own unique custom file type
    by creating two classes that adhere to a particular interface
  - Many of the existing built-in file types have been externalized to
    their own github repos and published as separate npm modules with
    the prefix "ilib-loctool-"
    - Custom projects can use these directly
    - Eventually, the built-in file type modules will go away, and
      all projects will use plugins exclusively

## 2.0.0

New Features:

- Added support for github-flavored markdown files
  - Text and some types of controls are extracted as translation units
  - Recomposes translations and markdwon together into translated markdown files
- HTML and Markdown now use coded text
  - Codes are in the form of XML-like tags in the source string.
    Example: "The files are <c0>not removed</c0> when you delete the index."
  - The codes represent html tags or other controls that do not affect the meaning
    of the source string or the translation.
  - The tags or controls may change in
    the source file without causing a new translatable string to appear, allowing
    the engineer to change non-text things without worrying about triggering a new
    translation.
  - The codes in the source file are used to recreate the target file
    at localization time by substituting them in to the translated string.
  - Coded text is a breaking change! Your translation xliffs from 1.X of loctool
    are not compatible because they include the HTML tags directly in the source
    and target. You will need to create new translation xliffs.

Bug Fixes:

- Strings inside of HTML &lt;code&gt; tags are now ignored.
- Most resources now appear in the xliff files in the order that they appear in
  the source files, allowing for easier debugging and for alignment of strings
  in files written in different languages.
- The "\*-extracted.xliff" file includes all duplicates of a resource now to help
  with alignment.
- Fixed some duplicate entries in the British and NZ spellings files

## 1.1.2

Bug Fixes:

- HTML and HTML template files were not localized properly when there is a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag in the text.
  The output included the attributes of the tag, but not the tag itself. This is corrected now.

## 1.1.1

Bug Fixes:

- the package.json was screwed up so it didn't publish the code. This is fixed now. No code
  differences from 1.1.0

## 1.1.0

New Features:

- Added support for plain HTML files
  - Text and certain tags are extracted as translation units
  - Recomposes translations and HTML together into translated HTML
- Added support for specifying the xliffsDir in the project.json
  - Directory where xliff files are read from
  - Can now be specified in the project.json under settings.xliffsDir
  - Can still be specified on the command-line with `-x dir` as before
  - Default is root dir of the project, as it was before
- Added support for the xliffsOut setting
  - Directory where xliff files are written
  - Can be specified in the project json under settings.xliffsOut
  - Can be specified on the command-line with `-z dir`
  - Default is root dir of the project, as it was before

Bug Fixes:

- Xliff merging was not working correctly due to mishandling of command-line parameters. Fixed now.
- Fixed a broken unit test

## 1.0.0

New Features:

- Open-sourced from HealthTap private repo
