 * @class A file loading cache that prevents race conditions by caching promises.
 *
 * This class is responsible for managing the loading of locale data files and
 * preventing race conditions when multiple callers attempt to load the same
 * files simultaneously. Instead of caching the loaded data, it caches the
 * promises to load the data, ensuring that concurrent requests for the same
 * files wait for the same promise to resolve.
 *
 * The FileCache class should not be instantiated directly. Instead, use the
 * `getFileCache()` factory method, which returns a file cache singleton.
