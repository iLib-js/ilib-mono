class Result {
    /**
     * Construct an ilib-lint rule check result. Rules should return this
     * type when reporting issues in the source files.
     *
     * Some extra notes about the properties in the fields parameter:
     *
     * - severity: Should have one of the following values:
     *     - suggestion - a suggestion of a better way to do things. The current way is
     *       not incorrect, but probably not optimal
     *     - warning - a problem that should be fixed, but which does not prevent
     *       your app from operating internationally. This is more severe than a suggestion.
     *     - error - a problem that must be fixed. This type of problem will prevent
     *       your app from operating properly internationally and could possibly even
     *       crash your app in some cases.
     * - description: In order to make the ilib-lint output useful, this description should
     *   attempt to make the following things clear:
     *     - What part is wrong
     *     - Why it is wrong
     *     - Suggestions on how to fix it
     *
     * For the `highlight` property, a snippet of the input that has a problem is reproduced
     * with XML tags around the problem part, if it is known. The tags are of the form
     * &lt;eX&gt; where X is a digit starting with 0 and progressing to 9 for each
     * subsequent problem. If the file type is XML already, the rest of the line will
     * be XML-escaped first.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * "const str = rb.getString(&lt;e0>id&lt;/e0>);"
     *
     * In this example rule, `getString()` must be called with a static string in order for
     * the loctool to be able to extract that string. The line above calls `getString()`
     * with a variable named "id" as a parameter instead of a static string, so it fails this
     * check. The variable is then highlighted with the e0 tag and put into the `highlight`
     * field of the Result instance. Callers can then translate the open and close tags
     * appropriately for the output device, such as ASCII escapes for a regular terminal, or
     * HTML tags for a web-based device.
     *
     * Only the severity, description, pathName, and rule are required. All other
     * properties are optional. All fields are stored in this result and are public.
