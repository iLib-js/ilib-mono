     * Type of intermediate representation that this rule can process. Rules can
     * be any type as long as there is a parser that produces that type. By convention,
     * there are a few types that are already defined:
     *
     * - resource - This checks a translated Resource instance with a source string
     *   and a translation string for a given locale. For example, a rule that checks that
     *   substitution parameters that exist in the source string also are
     *   given in the target string. Typically, resource files like po, properties, or xliff
     *   are parsed into an array of Resource instances as its intermediate representations.
     * - line - This rule checks single lines of a file. eg. a rule to
     *   check the parameters to a function call.
     * - string - This rule checks the entire file as a single string. Often, this type
     *   of representation is used with source code files that are checked with regular
     *   expressions, which often mean declarative rules.
     * - {other} - You can choose to return any other string here that uniquely identifies the
     *   representation that a parser produces.
     *
     * Typically, a full parser for a programming language will return something like
     * an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate format. For example, the acorn parser
     * for javascript returns an abstract syntax tree in JSTree format. The parser may
     * choose to return the string "ast-jstree" as its identifier, as long as there are
     * rules that are looking for that same string. The parser can return any string it
     * likes just as long as there are rules that know how to check it.
     *
     * Subclass should define this property to indicate that
     * it's meant for a specific type of representation (unless it's meant for the default "string").
