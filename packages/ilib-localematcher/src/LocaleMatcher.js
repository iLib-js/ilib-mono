     * Return the degree that the given locale matches the current locale of this

     * other. (eg. "ja-JP" and "ja-JP") A value of 0 means that there 0% match or

     *
     * Locale matching is not the same as equivalence, as the degree of matching
     * is returned. (See Locale.equals for equivalence.)<p>
     *
     * The match score is calculated based on matching the 4 locale components,
     * weighted by importance:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> language - this accounts for 50% of the match score
     * <li> region - accounts for 25% of the match score
     * <li> script - accounts for 20% of the match score
     * <li> variant - accounts for 5% of the match score
     * </ul>
     *
     * The score is affected by the following things:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> A large language score is given when the language components of the locales
     * match exactly.
     * <li> Higher language scores are given when the languages are linguistically
     * close to each other, such as dialects.
     * <li> A small score is given when two languages are in the same
     * linguistic family, but one is not a dialect of the other, such as German
     * and Dutch.
     * <li> A large region score is given when two locales share the same region.
     * <li> A smaller region score is given when one region is contained within
     * another. For example, Hong Kong is part of China, so a moderate score is
     * given instead of a full score.
     * <li> A small score is given if two regions are geographically close to
     * each other or are tied by history. For example, Ireland and Great Britain
     * are both adjacent and tied by history, so they receive a moderate score.
     * <li> A high script score is given if the two locales share the same script.
     * The legibility of a common script means that there is some small kinship of the
     * different languages.
     * <li> A high variant score is given if the two locales share the same
     * variant. Full score is given when both locales have no variant at all.
     * <li> Locale components that are unspecified in both locales are given high
     * scores.
     * <li> Locales where a particular locale component is missing in only one
     * locale can still match when the default for that locale component matches
     * the component in the other locale. The
     * default value for the missing component is determined using the likely locales
     * data. (See getLikelyLocale()) For example, "en-US" and "en-Latn-US" receive
     * a high script score because the default script for "en" is "Latn".
     * </ul>
     *
     * The intention of this method is that it can be used to determine
     * compatibility of locales. For example, when a user signs up for an
     * account on a web site, the locales that the web site supports and
     * the locale of the user's browser may differ, and the site needs to
     * pick the best locale to show the user. Let's say the
     * web site supports a selection of European languages such as "it-IT",
     * "fr-FR", "de-DE", and "en-GB". The user's
     * browser may be set to "it-CH". The web site code can then match "it-CH"
     * against each of the supported locales to find the one with the
     * highest score. In
     * this case, the best match would be "it-IT" because it shares a
     * language and script in common with "it-CH" and differs only in the region
     * component. It is not a 100% match, but it is pretty good. The web site
     * may decide if the match scores all fall
     * below a chosen threshold (perhaps 50%?), it should show the user the
     * default language "en-GB", because that is probably a better choice
     * than any other supported locale.<p>
     *
     * @param {Locale} locale the other locale to match against the current one
     * @return {number} an integer from 0 to 100 that indicates the degree to
     * which these locales match each other
