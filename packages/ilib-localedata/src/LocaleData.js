/**
 * @class A locale data instance.
 *
 * This class is a repository for locale-sensitive data only. For
 * non-locale data (ie. data that is not specific to a particular
 * locale), a class should load that data directly using a regular
 * javascript `import` statement or the asynchronous `import()`
 * function. This allows packagers like webpack
 * to include that data directly into the bundle.<p>
 *
 * Locale data instances should not be created directly. Instead,
 * use the `getLocaleData()` factory method, which returns a locale
 * data singleton.<p>
 *
 * Packages should not attempt to load any
 * locale data of another package. The other package may change what
 * data it stores, or how it is stored or encoded, without notice,
 * so depending
 * on another package's data is dangerous. Instead, that other package should
 * be designed to provide a stable API for the current package to get
 * any information that it may need.<p>
 *
 * <h2>Finding Data</h2>
 *
 * This class finds locale data in multiple ways:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>by looking in the cache. If the required data is already loaded, it is
 * returned immediately. When loading data asynchronously, if the data is
 * found in the cache, a promise is
 * still returned, even though is resolved immediately.
 * <li>by looking for files that contain data about an entire locale.
 * <li>by looking for files that contain data about parts of a locale.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Locale Data Files</h2>
 *
 * Files containing locale data can be encoded in two ways:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>JSON files. Data can be encoded as JSON files in JSON5 format.
 * <li>JS files. Data can be encoded inside of JS files that contain a
 * module that returns the locale data. These type of files may be loaded
 * dynamically when needed using "import", but are only available in
 * async mode.
 * </ol>
 *
 * All files need to be encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * <h2>Roots</h2>
 *
 * Files are loaded from a list of roots. The locale data loader looks in
 * each root in order to find the locale data. When the file is
 * found, the locale data loader will stop looking in subsequent roots for
 * more data. The last root in the list is typically the "locale" directory
 * within the package itself and contains the locale data that the package
 * was originally shipped with. In
 * this way, locale data that comes with a package can be overridden by
 * other data that is perhaps customized by the app or the operating system
 * or it might be updated from what is in the original package.<p>
 *
 * The list of roots is global, shared by all instances of the locale data
 * class no matter what type of data is being loaded. In this way, an app
 * can set the roots once and all locale data
 * instances will use the same list. There are a number of static methods
 * on the locale data class to manage the list of roots.<p>
 *
 * For optimization, a root may contain a file named "ilibmanifest.json".
 * If it is there, it will be loaded first. It should list all of the
 * contents of that root, and is used to prevent the loader from needing to
 * test whether files exist in the file system. That makes the file loader
 * a little faster since only the files that actually exist will be read.
 * For example, let's say we are attempting to load the locale data for
 * number formatting, but this root does not have any such data, the locale
 * data instance can avoid checking multiple directories/files inside that
 * root for the existance of that data, and skip directly on to the next root.<p>
 *
 * <h2>Locale Data Files</h2>
 *
 * The locale data loader will look in each root for data about a particular
 * locale. There are two styles of locale data:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Locale data for an entire locale at once
 * <li>Locale data split into constituent locale parts and data types
 * </ol>
 *
 * Files named for the entire locale appear in the top of the root and have
 * the form "[locale-spec].json" or "[locale-spec].js". For example, data for
 * the Danish locale for Denmark would appear in "[root]/da-DK.json" file,
 * and would contain data for multiple data types.<p>
 *
 * Data that is split in to its locale parts exists in directories named after
 * the locale parts in files of the form "[basename].json" or "[basename].js".
 * For example, data for number formatting in the locale Danish for Denmark
 * would appear in the file "[root]/da/DK/numfmt.json".<p>
 *
 * The purpose for splitting the locale data into separate parts is so that the various
 * parts can be
 * cobbled together to support any arbitrary locale. For example, Vietnamese is
 * spoken by a minority of people in the United States, but the the locale
 * "vi-US" is not one that is normally specified. Yet that locale can be supported
 * simply by
 * combining the locale data for the Vietnamese language and the locale data
 * for the US region.<p>
 *
 * The data can be split into various parts based on which part of the locale
 * that the data is dependent upon. Some data is dependent on the language, some
 * on the region, some the script, and some on any combination of language, script,
 * or region. When the locale data class loads this data, it starts
 * off with the most generic information, which is the world-wide "root" locale,
 * and progressively overrides it with more specific info if it exists.
 * For example, number formatting is dependent on
 * both language and region. In Italian, the number grouping separator character is
 * a regular period. But Italian as spoken in Switzerland uses the
 * apostrophe ’ character instead. In this case, the "it-CH" locale would use most
 * of the settings from the root or the "it" language except for the grouping character,
 * which uses the more specific data of the apostrophe for the grouping character.<p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> [root]/numfmt.json -> contains grouping separator character is comma "," which is
 *  default for the world. eg. 100,000
 * <li>[root]/it/numfmt.json -> contains the grouping separator char period "." for any
 * place that speaks Italian, including Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, and Vatican City
 * as well as small parts of Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia. eg. 100.000
 * <li>[root]/it/CH/numfmt.json -> contains the grouping separator char apostrophe "’"
 * specifically for Italian as it is spoken in Switzerland. eg. 100’000
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Order of Specificity</h2>
 *
 * Locale data that is split based on locale parts are merged together to form the data
 * for the whole locale. It is merged starting with the least specific data (ie. default
 * data for the whole world) and going to the most specific data (ie. data that is
 * dependent on all of the specified locale parts.). The following list defines the
 * order in which the parts are merged:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> "root" (default for the whole world)
 * <li> language
 * <li> und/region
 * <li> language/script
 * <li> language/region
 * <li> region/variant
 * <li> language/script/region
 * <li> language/region/variant
 * <li> language/script/region/variant
 * </ol>
 *
 * If a file does not exist that contains locale data for that part of the locale, it will
 * simply be skipped. Note in the above, region-specific data appears under "und/region"
 * as the language is the minimum locale part and is required. The tag "und" stands for
 * the "undefined" language, which ilib uses to mean "all languages".
 *
 * <h2>Synchronicity and Caching</h2>
 *
 * Data is loaded using an instance of a Loader from the ilib-loader package.
 * All locale data can be imported asynchronously, as every loader must support
 * asynchronous operation. Some loaders, such as the one for Node.js can also support
 * synchronous operation. When the LocaleData instance is created, you can request to
 * use synchronous operation, but the loader may not support it. Call the `isSync` method
 * after the LocaleData instance is created to find out whether or not you can operate
 * in synchronous mode.<p>
 *
 * The LocaleData instance can return data synchronously, even in asynchronous mode, if
 * the data is already cached. The data can get into the cache in multiple ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Using `ensureLocale`. Some locale data can be pre-loaded from js files using the
 * `ensureLocale` method which will load the files asynchronously.
 *
 * <li>Using `cacheData`. Data can be explicitly cached as well if you have some statically
 * loaded data in your
 * application and you wish to add it to the cache. Use the `cacheData` method to add
 * it to the cache.
 *
 * <li>With a previous asynchronous call. If you create an ilib class asynchronously, its
 * data will be loaded into the cache for the requested locale. After the asynchronous call
 * completes, you can then create other instances for the same locale synchronously. For
 * example, if you load a date formatter for locale "de-DE" that formats the date and time
 * together, you can then synchronously create another data formatter for the same "de-DE"
 * locale that only formats the date or the time by itself, since they rely on the same
 * date formatting data.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The cache for locale data is shared amongst all instances of LocaleData in the global
 * scope. This means that if you have 2 copies of an ilib class loaded into your app,
 * they will share the same cache. Having 2 copies happens under nodejs for example if
 * those two copies are located in different paths with your application or if there are
 * two slightly different versions of the same ilib class.<p>
 *
 * If you are not sure whether or not data for your ilib class has been loaded yet, you
 * can use the `checkData` method to check. Ilib classes will use this method as well
 * to check if they can operate synchronously at the moment, even when the loader is in
 * asynchronous mode, because the locale data they need is already cached.

     * Ensure that the data for a particular locale is loaded into the
     * cache so that it is available for future synchronous use.<p>
     *
     * If the method completes successfully, the data is cached in the
     * same caching object as if the data was loaded with `loadData` method.
     * Because of this, future callers are not required
     * to call `loadData` asynchronously, even when the loader does not
     * support synchronous loading because the data is already cached.
     * The idea behind `ensureLocale` is to pre-load the data into the
     * cache. If the loader for the current platform
     * supports synchronous loading, this method will return a Promise that
     * resolves to true immediately because `loadData` can return the data
     * on-demand and it does not need to be pre-loaded.<p>
     *
     * This method will look for files that are named [locale].js or
     * [locale].json where the locale is given as the full locale
     * specification. It looks for these files in the same list of roots
     * that `loadData` uses and merges the data it finds together. Data
     * from roots earlier in the list take precedence over data from roots
     * later in the list.<p>
     *
     * The files named for the locale should contain the data of multiple
     * types. The first level of properties in the data should be the sublocales
     * of the locale. Within the sublocale property is the the basename
     * of the data. The properties within the basename property are the actual
     * locale data. For javascript files, the file should be a commonjs or
     * ESM style module that exports a function that takes no parameters.
     * This function should return the type of data described above.<p>
     *
     * Example file "de-DE.js":
     *
     * <code>
     * export default function getLocaleData() {
     *     return {
     *         "root": {
     *             "phonefmt": {
     *                 "default": {
     *                     "example": "+1 211 555 1212",
     *                     etc.
     *                 }
     *             }
     *          },
     *          "de": {
     *             "localeinfo": {
     *                 "clock": "24",
     *                 etc.
     *             }
     *          },
     *          "und-DE": {
     *             "phonefmt": {
     *                 "default": {
     *                     "example": "030 12 34 56 78",
     *                     etc.
     *                 }
     *             },
     *             "numplan": {
     *                 "region": "DE",
     *                 "countryCode": "+49",
     *                 etc.
     *             }
     *          }
     *          "de-DE": {}
     *     };
     * };
     * </code>
     *
     * The idea behind the sublocales is that the data for each sublocale can
     * be cached separately so that if a locale is requested that uses that
     * sublocale, it is available. For example, if the "de-DE" locale is
     * loaded with this method (as in the example above), the code may request
     * locale data for the "de" locale or the "und-DE" locale separately and it
     * will get the right data. Most
     * usefully, the root locale is given separately, so any requested locale
     * that does not match any of the sublocales can use the root locale data.<p>
     *
     * If the data is loaded successfully, the Promise returned from this method
     * will resolve to `true`.
     * If there was an error loading the files, or if no files were found to
     * load, the Promise will resolve to `false`.<p>
     *
     * @param {Locale|string} locale the Locale object or a string containing
     * the locale spec
     * @param {Array.<string>=} otherRoots an array of extra roots to search (other than
     * the global roots) or undefined for no other roots
     * @returns {Promise} a promise to load the data with the resolved
     * value of true if the load was successful, and false if not
     * @fulfil {boolean} true if the locale data was successfully loaded or
     * false if it could be found
     * @reject {Error} if there was an error while loading the data
