     *
     * There are no options that this loader uses, so the options parameter is
     * ignored.<p>
     *
     * The file loaded must be a javascript file named for the full BCP-47 locale
     * spec (eg. "zh-Hans-CN.js") or "root.js" for the generic shared data. The
     * files should be constructed before webpack is
     * called. In order to include the data file automatically in webpack, you must
     * create a resolver alias called "calling-module" to point to the location where
     * the file was generated. Example setting in webpack.config.js
     *
     * <code>
     *    "resolve": {
     *        "alias": {
     *            "calling-module": "my-module/locale"
     *        }
     *    }
     * </code>
     *
     * The value may be the name of your module with an optional subpath, or the
     * absolute path to the directory where the files are stored. Without this alias,
     * no files will be included and the webpack build will fail.<p>
     *
     * For files that end with a ".js" or ".mjs" extension, this method should
     * treat the file as a Javascript module and load it accordingly. All other
     * file types will be loaded as UTF-8 text.
     *
     * @param {string} pathName a file name to load
     * @param {Object} options options guiding the load, as per above
     * @returns {Promise|undefined} A promise to load the file contents
     * in async mode. If this method returns undefined or the promise resolves
     * to the value undefined, this indicates that the file did not exist or
     * could not be loaded.
