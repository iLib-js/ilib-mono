# Loctool Development Standards

## Plugin Architecture
Loctool uses a plugin-based architecture where each file format has its own plugin:
- `loctool` - Main CLI application
- `ilib-loctool-*` - Format-specific plugins (JSON, XML, JavaScript, etc.)

## Plugin Development
When creating or modifying loctool plugins:
- Extend the base plugin class from `loctool`
- Implement required methods: `parse()`, `write()`, `getDataType()`
- Handle locale-specific resource files properly
- Support both source and target locale processing
- Include proper error handling for malformed files
- Plugins should be written with commonjs and ES2015 Javascript code unless already upgraded

## Resource Handling
- Parse source files to extract translatable strings
- Generate resource files for target locales
- Handle pluralization rules correctly
- Support context and comments for translators
- Validate resource data integrity
- Resource, ResourceArray, ResourcePlural, and ResourceString are different in loctool than
  the ones in ilib-tools-common which should not be used in the plugins (yet)

## File Format Support
Each plugin should support:
- Reading source files in the target format
- Writing localized files in the same format
- Preserving file structure and formatting
- Handling encoding issues (UTF-8 preferred)
- Supporting locale-specific file naming

## Testing Loctool Plugins
- Test with various file formats and encodings
- Verify locale-specific behavior
- Test error handling for malformed files
- Include integration tests with the main loctool CLI
- Test plugin loading and registration

## Debugging
Use the provided debugging commands:
```bash
# Debug loctool with plugins
NODE_PATH=packages node --inspect packages/loctool/loctool.js
```

## Configuration
- Support plugin-specific configuration options
- Handle default locale settings
- Support custom output directories
- Allow format-specific options in project configuration
