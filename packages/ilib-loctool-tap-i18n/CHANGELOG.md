# ilib-loctool-tap-i18n

## 1.1.1

- fixed a problem between using loctool internal resources and ilib-tools-common
  resources. They are almost the same, but not completely, which lead to
  problems in producing localized versions of the tap yaml files.

## 1.1.0

- Added the ability to use the global locale mapping

## 1.0.0

- Initial version
