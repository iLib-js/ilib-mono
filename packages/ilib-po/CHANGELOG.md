# ilib-po

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 638b54e: - Fixed handling of Polish plural categories in PO files. The categories `one`, `few`, and `many` are now correctly recognized and processed.
  - Added logic to backfill the `many` plural category with the `other` category for Polish when `many` is missing in the incoming `Resource` object.
- Updated dependencies [2e65e98]
  - ilib-tools-common@1.15.0

## 1.1.2

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 9cadb43: Fixed syntax errors in generated PO file when there are linebreaks in comments for translators.

  - ilib-tools-common@1.14.0

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0672f4c: - Added the ability to ilib-po to encode ResourceArray resources. The array elements
  are encoded as separate resources with the key of the array resource
  and the index of the array element both encoded in new types of comments
  in the po file. These are po file format extensions which are mostly
  ignored by other po file tools, but are used by the ilib-po parser and
  generator to encode the array elements in a reversible way.
  - The above work with ResourceArray resources now also allow you to add
    a key to each resource that is different than source string. This goes
    for all resource types, not just arrays.
  - Fixed a bug where resources that have comments in them which are not
    in json format were parsed as if they were json. Now the parser will
    only treat comments as json if they start with a '{' character.
