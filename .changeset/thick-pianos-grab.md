"ilib-loctool-po": patch

- Improved support for Polish plural categories in PO file localization. The `many` category is now correctly handled and backfilled with the `other` category when missing.
- Enhanced PO file parsing to ensure accurate recognition of Polish plural forms (`one`, `few`, `many`).
