     * Many parsers produce an abstract syntax tree. The tree could have

     * as well as additional information that depends on the type of
     * the node.

     *
     * - lines - just split the file into an array of lines in order
     * - string - treat the whole file like a big string
     * - concrete syntax tree - a tree the represents the actual
     *   syntactical elements in the file. This can be converted to
     *   an abstract syntax tree afterwards, which would be more useful
     *   for checking for problems.
     * - resources - array of instances of Resource classes as
     *   defined in {@link https://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-tools-common}.
     *   This is the preference intermediate representation for
     *   resource files like Java properties or xliff. There are many
