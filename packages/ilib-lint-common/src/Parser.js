     *
     * Many parsers produce an abstract syntax tree. The tree could have
     * a different style depending on the programming language, but
     * generally, each node has a type, a name, and an array of children,
     * as well as additional information that depends on the type of
     * the node.
     *
     * Other types of intermediate representation could include:
     *
     * - lines - just split the file into an array of lines in order
     * - string - treat the whole file like a big string
     * - concrete syntax tree - a tree the represents the actual
     *   syntactical elements in the file. This can be converted to
     *   an abstract syntax tree afterwards, which would be more useful
     *   for checking for problems.
     * - resources - array of instances of Resource classes as
     *   defined in {@link https://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-tools-common}.
     *   This is the preference intermediate representation for
     *   resource files like Java properties or xliff. There are many
     *   rules that already know how to process Resource instances.
     * - * - the star is a special type that means that the pipeline element
     *   can handle any type of file. Typically, this is used for pipeline elements
     *   that are used to check the content of the file for problems that are
     *   not related to the structure of the file itself, such as checking for
     *   character encoding problems or other issues.
     *

     * @abstract
     * @returns {IntermediateRepresentation[]} the intermediate representations
