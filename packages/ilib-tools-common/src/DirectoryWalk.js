/**
 * Recursively walk a directory and return a list of files and directories
 * within that directory. The walk is controlled via a list of exclude and
 * include patterns. Each pattern should be a micromatch pattern like this:
 *
 * <code>
 * "*.json"
 * </code>
 *
 * The full relative path to every file and directory in the top-level directory
 * will be included, unless it matches an exclude pattern, it which case, it will
 * be excluded from the output. However, if the path
 * also matches an include pattern, it will still be included nonetheless. The
 * idea is that you can exclude a whole category of files (like all json files),
 * but include specific ones. For example, you may exclude all json files, but
 * still want to include the "config.json" file.<p>
 *
 * The return value is an array of objects that look like this:
 * <code>
 * {
 *   "type": "file",
 *   "path": "a/b/c/d"
 * }
 *
 * or
 *
 * {
 *   "type": "directory",
 *   "path": "a/b/c/e",
 *   "children": [
 *     {
 *       "type": "file",
 *       "path": "a/b/c/e/f"
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "type": "file",
 *       "path": "a/b/c/e/g"
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * That is, each entry is either a file or a directory. If it is a directory, it will have a "children"
 * property that contains an array of the children of that directory. The path property is the full path
 * to the file or directory relative to the root directory.
 *
 * @param {Array<String>} includes A list of micromatch patterns to include in the walk.
 * If a pattern matches both an exclude and an include, the
 * include will override the exclude.
 * @param {Array<String>} excludes A list of micromatch patterns to exclude from the walk.
 * If a pattern matches a directory, that directory will not be recursively searched.
 * @returns {DirItem[]} an array of file names in the directory, filtered
 * by the excludes and includes list
