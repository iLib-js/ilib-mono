/**
 * @class superclass for pipeline elements
 *
 * A pipeline element is the superclass for all classes that can be used
 * in a pipeline. A pipeline is used to process a particular type
 * of file. Pipeline elements are used in sequence to parse, then transform,
 * and then serialize the content of the file. Each element can be used along
 * with a number of other pipeline elements of the same type which all
 * process the same type of file. Each pipeline element should define a type,
 * a name, and a description.

     * instances with the same type are sent in to that element for processing.

     * There are three types that are reserved, however:

     * - resource - the pipeline element returns an array of Resource instances as
     *   defined in {@link https://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-tools-common}.
     * - line - the pipeline element produces a set of lines as an array of strings
     * - string - the pipeline element doesn't parse. Instead, it just treats the
     *   the file as one long string.
     * - * - the star is a special type that means that the pipeline element
     *   can handle any type of file. Typically, this is used for pipeline elements
     *   that are used to check the content of the file for problems that are
     *   not related to the structure of the file itself, such as checking for
     *   character encoding problems or other issues.
