## Migration from 1.x.x to 2.0.0

### Schema path resolution

This breaking change updates the behaviour of schema path resolution in loctool's json plugin - paths are now resolved relative to the loctool project's root rather than the current working directory (from which loctool was invoked). Change is only required if you have been running loctool from a different directory than the root of your project.

For example, if you have a monorepo with the following structure:

```plaintext
packages/
    project1/
        project.json
        schemas/
        src/
    project2/
        project.json
        schemas/
        src/
    ```
```

and you have been running loctool from the root of the monorepo per-package like

```bash
yarn loctool localize packages/project1
yarn loctool localize packages/project2
```

Then you need to change the schemas directory path in each of `packages/*/project.json` configs from
```json
"schemas": [
    "packages/project1/schemas"
],
```
to
```json
"schemas": [
    "schemas"
],
```
