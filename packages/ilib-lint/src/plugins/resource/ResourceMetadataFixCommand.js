     * replacement of the 3rd and 4th char has range `[2, 4)` and they don't overlap)

     * **with the exception of** 0-length replacements, i.e. pure insertion commands
     * which (even though mathematically `[1,1)` would be empty interval):
     * - overlap with different commands from the left side (i.e. insertion at 1 overlaps removal `[0,2)`,
     * but not removal `[0,1)`)
     * - overlap with each other when their position is the same (this is because the outcome
     * of multiple insertions in the same place would depend on the order of execution)
