     * the rule set to include those new rules and users of this plugin
     * will get enhanced functionality automatically without changing
     * their own configuration.<p>
     *
     * For example, if there is a plugin named
     * "android", the plugin writer can add support for Java, Kotlin,
     * and properties files in the same plugin by adding parsers and rules
     * for each file type. They can then also add rulesets called "java",
     * "kotlin" and "properties" which will apply all the rules from this
     * plugin that are appropriate for the file types.<p>
     *
     * By convention, these rulesets are named the same as the file type
     * that they support, but this is not a strict requirement. Plugin
     * writers should document the rulesets that the plugin supports in
     * the README.md for that plugin so that users know that it is available.
     *
     * @returns {Object} an object where the properties are the names of
     * rulesets and the values are objects that configure a ruleset. The
     * properties of this subobject are the names of the rules and the
