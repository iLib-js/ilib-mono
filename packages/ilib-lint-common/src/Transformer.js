 * A transformer is a plugin that takes an intermediate representation of a
 * file and transforms it in some way, and returns a new intermediate
 * representation that is a modified version of the original. For example,
 * a filter transformer might remove some of the entries in the intermediate
 * representation that match a certain pattern, or it might
 * add new entries to the intermediate representation.
