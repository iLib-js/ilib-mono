Now supports use of apostrophes for contractions and ellisions
in those languages that use them. The Quote Style
Checker rule now does not give false positive results when the
apostrophes are used in contractions or ellisions.
    - Contractions: English, French, Portuguese, Catalan, Italian
    - Ellisions: Irish, Samoan, Hawaiian
