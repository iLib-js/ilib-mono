     * Modify the Intermediate Representation instance by applying provided fixes.
     * Fix can be anything as long as the Fixer knows how to apply it onto the IR,
     * as described in {@link Fix}.
     * 
     * Fixer should know to avoid applying conflicting fixes
     * (i.e. those that would modify the same part of the underlying representation)
     * or to offset subsequent fixes after applying one of them.
     * 
     * For those fixes that have been applied, Fixer is expected to set the flag {@link Fix.applied}.
     * 
     * Example scenario:
     * 
     * Take an IntermediateRepresentation with type `string`
     * which stores content of a file verbatim:
     * ```text
     * birds are not real birds are not real birds are not real
     * ```
     * and a Rule (type `string`) which ensures that the word `birds`
     * should always be surrounded by quotes.
     * 
     * The following fixes have been produced:
     * 1. insert `"` at 0 and 5
     * 2. insert `"` at 19 and 24
     * 3. insert `"` at 38 and 43
     * 
     * Expected fixed string is:
     * ```text
     * "birds" are not real "birds" are not real "birds" are not real
     * ```
     * Which contains quotes at 0, 6, 21, 27, 42, 48. In this scenario, fixer needs to know
     * that after every time it inserted some string into the IR, it needs to offset indices
     * of the remaining insertion points appropriately.
     * 
     * Take another Rule which ensures that the file should always begin with an exclamation mark.
     * It would produce the following fix:
     * 1. insert `!` at 0
     * 
     * This fix overlaps with fix from the other rule (insert `"` at 0 and 5) because the fixer
     * can't tell which symbol goes first (`"!birds"` or `!"birds"`). One of those fixes
     * needs to be skipped.
     *
     * @param {IntermediateRepresentation} ir Intermediate Representaion instance which will be
     * modified by the fixer when the fixes are applied
     * @param {Fix[]} fixes Array of fixes which Fixer should attempt to apply
     * @returns {void}
     * @abstract
