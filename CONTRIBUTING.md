## Environment

This project is developed using the following tools:

-   `nvm` for runtime version management ([installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating))
-   `NodeJS v22 LTS` runtime (recommended installation through `nvm install` and later usage through `nvm use`: [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))
-   `pnpm v9` package manager (recommended installation through Corepack: [installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack))
    -   pro tip: `pnpm` might be annoying to type; you can alias it to `pn` instead ([guide here](https://pnpm.io/installation#adding-a-permanent-alias-on-posix-systems))
