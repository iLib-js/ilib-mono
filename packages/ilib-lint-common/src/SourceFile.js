/**
 * @class Represent a source file. Source files are text files that are
 * candidates for applying lint rules. Source files could mean any type of
 * text file. Examples may include source code files written in some programming
 * language, CSS files, HTML files, config files, resource files used to represent
 * translations for a product, or XLIFF files that contain all the translations
 * for a product. The source file may have subclasses that could represent data
 * that is more ephemeral, such as the rows of a database table. The URI passed
 * to the constructor should contain sufficient information for this class
 * or a subclass to be able to load the data from where it is stored.
 * The intention is that parsers classes should produce these
 * as a by-product of loading and parsing the text file on disk as a way of
 * representing the data that is being linted.
