# Core Libraries Development Standards

## Core Library Architecture
The core ilib libraries provide fundamental internationalization functionality:
- `ilib-common` - Common utilities and base classes
- `ilib-locale` - Locale handling and normalization
- `ilib-ctype` - Character type classification
- `ilib-istring` - Internationalized string operations
- `ilib-address` - Address formatting and validation

## API Design Principles
- Provide consistent APIs across all core libraries
- Use factory patterns for locale-specific objects
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Include comprehensive parameter validation
- Provide fallback mechanisms for unsupported locales

## Locale Handling
- Use BCP 47 locale identifiers (e.g., "en-US", "zh-Hans-CN")
- Support locale fallback chains
- Handle locale-specific data loading
- Provide locale normalization and validation
- Support locale-specific formatting rules

## Character and String Operations
- Support Unicode standards (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32)
- Handle locale-specific collation and sorting
- Support bidirectional text (RTL/LTR)
- Provide proper case mapping for different locales
- Handle locale-specific number and date formatting

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy-load locale data when possible
- Cache frequently used objects and calculations
- Minimize memory footprint for large datasets
- Use efficient algorithms for string operations
- Support streaming for large text processing

## Testing Core Libraries
- Test with multiple locales and scripts
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test performance with large datasets
- Verify Unicode compliance
- Test locale fallback mechanisms

## Documentation
- Provide comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Include usage examples for common scenarios
- Document locale-specific behavior
- Provide migration guides for API changes
- Include performance considerations
